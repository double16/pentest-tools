Collection of tools and scripts for penetration testing.

# Kali Container

The `kali/container` directory contains a docker compose file and related images I use for headless work, generally
for long term scans. It has a "Private Internet Access" VPN.

Start the stack using `./up.sh`. Stop it with `./up.sh down`.

In the `/config/pia-auth.conf` file of the `kali-pia` container, add the username and password on separate lines and
restart the container.

The `/data` volume in the `kali-kali` container is intended for pen test artifacts. You'll see I use Dropbox and
the `up.sh` script searches for my particular folder.

Enter the container for work:

```shell
$ docker exec -it --user kali:kali kali-kali-1 /usr/bin/zsh -l
```
